# Programming and Scripting

## About this Project

This repository contains my weekly assignments for ATU module 8640 -- WEB SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS. It contains the project work for the course, which is focused on the construction of a REST API which will display information related to the old SFI grant comitments file. The intentions is this API will have a numer of features:

1. An accompanying web interface, using AJAX calls, to perform CRUD operations. 
2. The ability to link to, and update, outside datasets.
3. Have multiple database tables.
4. Will be hosted online via PythonAnywhere.

## Use of this Project

This repository may be of some interest to other students engaged in similar projects around web services and APIs. Feel free to use whatever you like from it (though if another party has been referenced, I would ask that you likewise cite them).
